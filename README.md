🏠 Bangalore House Price Predictor – Data Intelligence in Real Estate📌 Problem Statement: The "Information Asymmetry" in Urban HousingThe Bangalore real estate market is notorious for its price volatility. Potential homebuyers and investors often face:Inconsistent Unit Data: Listings use a mix of Square Feet, Square Yards, and Acres, making direct comparison impossible.The "Outlier" Trap: Many listings contain data entry errors (e.g., a 10-bedroom house listed at 500 sq. ft.) that skew market averages.Dimensionality Chaos: With over 1,300 unique locations, traditional analysis fails to capture local price nuances effectively.Opaque Pricing: Lack of a standardized tool to estimate fair market value based on physical attributes.💡 Our Solution: House Price PredictorThis project serves as an end-to-end data pipeline that transforms raw, messy real estate listings into a high-precision prediction engine.We don't just "guess" the price; we sanitize and validate the data to ensure the model learns from realistic market conditions.At its core, this project uses Advanced Feature Engineering and Statistical Outlier Scrubbing to provide:✅ Standardized property metrics✅ Logic-based data validation✅ Location-specific price intelligence🧠 How It Works1️⃣ Data Sanitization & HarmonizationUnit Normalization: Custom logic converts non-standard entries like "2100 - 2850" (ranges) or "34.46 Sq. Meter" into a uniform float value in Square Feet.Structural Cleaning: "2 BHK" and "4 Bedroom" entries are stripped and converted into a standard numerical bhk feature.2️⃣ Strategic Outlier Removal (The Intelligence Layer)Domain Logic Filter: We remove entries where the square footage per bedroom is less than 300 (a standard threshold for livable space).Location-Based Statistical Filter: Using Mean and Standard Deviation, we remove properties priced significantly higher or lower than the local average for that specific neighborhood.3️⃣ High-Dimensional EncodingTo handle 240+ unique locations without introducing a false hierarchy, we utilize One-Hot Encoding, creating a sparse matrix that allows the model to treat every neighborhood as a distinct variable.🏗️ System ArchitectureThe project follows a modular 5-stage pipeline:Ingestion: Loading raw CSV data from Kaggle.Preprocessing: Handling null values and type casting.Feature Engineering: Calculating price_per_sqft to identify market anomalies.Transformation: One-Hot Encoding and Dimensionality reduction (grouping rare locations into "Other").Modeling & Validation: Executing K-Fold Cross Validation to ensure result stability.🛠️ Tech Stack🔹 Data ManipulationPandas: Primary tool for cleaning, grouping, and filtering.NumPy: Used for vectorization and handling "NaN" logic.🔹 Machine Learning & StatisticsScikit-learn (sklearn): * LinearRegression (Baseline)RandomForestRegressor (Complex non-linear patterns)ShuffleSplit & cross_val_score (Validation)🔹 VisualizationMatplotlib: For identifying data distributions and outliers.📊 Model Performance & ResultsWe compared two distinct approaches to determine the most robust predictor:ModelAlgorithm TypeResult (R2 Score)StatusLinear RegressionLinear RelationshipCatastrophic Failure❌ RejectedRandom ForestEnsemble Learning~65% Accuracy✅ SelectedObservation: The Random Forest model successfully captured the non-linear relationship between location prestige and property size, which the Linear model failed to interpret.🚀 Impact & Benefits💰 Fair Value Estimation: Helps buyers identify if a property is overpriced compared to the local neighborhood standard.📉 Reduced Error: By removing statistical outliers, the model provides realistic estimates rather than being skewed by luxury "villas" in middle-class areas.🛠️ Developer Foundation: This pipeline can be integrated into real estate apps to provide instant "Price Estimates" via API.🔮 Future EnhancementsWeb Deployment: Building a Flask/React UI for user-friendly price estimation.Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV to push the Random Forest score higher.Geospatial Data: Integrating GPS coordinates to calculate proximity to the Bangalore Metro or IT Parks.📄 LicenseThis project is for academic and demonstration purposes.✨ Building a transparent future for the Bangalore real estate market.
